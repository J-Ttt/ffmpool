      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <hr />
	  <p>
		 To get started mining and use this pool you need the following
		 <ul>
			<li>{{ coinName }} Wallet address</li>
			<li>Mining software that supports the {{ coinName }} coin and algorithm {{ aglorithm }}</li>
			<li>Hardware to run it on. This can be your home PC, mining rig or cloud mining for example.</li>
		 </ul>
		 </br>
		 <h4>{{ coinName }} Wallet address</h4>
		 A wallet address is needed to payout you shares mined at this pool server. Get your wallet for Bamboo <a href="https://github.com/f10crypto/bamboowallet/releases">here</a></br>
		 When the total mined value is past the payout threshold, we will send your coin to this wallet address.</br>
		 </br>
		 </br>
		 <h4>Mining Software</h4>
		 To mine at this pool you can use any miner supporting the {{ aglorithm }} algorithm or {{ coinName }} coin.</br>
		 Currently only one miner is supported <a href="https://github.com/De-Crypted/dcrptd-miner/releases">download here</a>.
		 Download the miner from releases and configure the miner.</br>
